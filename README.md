## How to use the Project

The application functions quite similarly to the etch-a-sketch toys you may remember as a child that would allow you to draw an image and erase the page to start again. To do so you simply hover your mouse over the canvas and watch the magic happen!

- **The Color Picker:** Enables you to select a color you might wish to draw in. It allows you to do this via RGB, color palette or the eye dropper. To use it simply click the colored circle and select your color choice from there.
- **Clear:** This will refresh the canvas back to its initial state while keeping the canvas size the same.
- **Pen:** This is the default pen that is used along with the color selector to allow you to draw over the canvas at your selected color.
- **Rainbow Pen:** The rainbow pen functions exactly the same as the standard pen, however the color will be a randomly generated RGB and will not be determined by the color picker.
- **Eraser:** The eraser will allow you to return parts of the canvas to their blank state and functions the same as the pen, only requiring you to hover your mouse over that area of the canvas.
- **Canvas Size Slider:** This slider enables you to pick the respective size of your canvas, it will allow for a grid size of up to 100 elements and the current size is displayed in the text above the slider.
